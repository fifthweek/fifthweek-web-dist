Of course! And the extra awesome stuff your favourite creators produce? Well, it may not exist. 'Free' is limited: it restricts creation. </p> <p> We're missing out, and we'd rather extra content existed as a paid service from creators, than not at all. Fifthweek makes more content possible. </p> <h4>Creators</h4> <p>Setup your own subscription channel and publish more digital content on a regular basis, supported by paying subscribers.</p> <a class="btn btn-success" href="#/register" role="button" id="registerLink">Become a creator &raquo;</a> </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-4"> <h3>What is Fifthweek?</h3> <p>Fifthweek is a micro-subscription platform that makes it easy to create low-cost subscriptions that are convenient for subscribers.</p> <p>We make it really simple to share great content with those who value it. It's like Tumblr, but for content worth paying for.</p> </div> <div class="col-md-4"> <h3>How it works</h3> <p> Creators setup their own subscription channel through Fifthweek and publish digital content on a regular basis. Subscribers pay a small weekly subscription to the creator, and receive more content in return. </p> <p> It's not about restricting existing content, it's the opposite: we allow more to be produced. </p> </div> <div class="col-md-4"> <h3>What makes it different</h3> <p>Todo.</p> </div> </div>
