Consumers pay a small weekly subscription to the creator - typically around $0.50 per week - which makes the extra work possible. </p> <p> It's not about restricting existing content, it's the opposite: we allow more to be produced. This is only possible if creators receive the financial support to do so. </p> </div> <div class="col-md-4"> <h2>Are you a creator?</h2> <p> We'd love your feedback as we develop the platform. </p> <p> Please register to see the current progress of the project, and to be notified once the platform's launched. </p> <p> Your feedback will help shape the platform and empower other creators to produce more independently. </p> <p><a class="btn btn-default" href="#/register" role="button" id="registerLink">Register &raquo;</a></p> </div> <div class="col-md-4"> <h2>Already registered?</h2> <p>Sign in for the latest news or to get in touch!</p> <p><a class="btn btn-default" href="#/signin" role="button" id="signInLink">Sign in &raquo;</a></p> </div> </div> </div>
